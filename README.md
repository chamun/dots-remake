### Dots Remake

This a remake of the game [Dots: A Game About
Connecting](http://weplaydots.com/) written in Java using
[Processing](http://processing.org/).

### How to compile

These instructions assume you are on a Linux machine and have the JDK
installed. I think this may also work on a Mac and the java/javac
commands inside the \*.sh files are probably the same on Windows.

1. Make sure all \*.sh files are executable

   	$ chmod 755 \*.sh

1. Run ./compile.sh
1. Run ./run.sh
1. Have fun!
